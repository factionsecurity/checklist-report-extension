# Checklist Report Extension
This extension adds checklists to a table in your Faction reports. 

To use this extension you need to have clecklists enabled on an assessment and include the magic variable in your report template. The magic variable is `${checklist-[[[[name-of-your-checklist]]]}`

For example if you have this checklist in Faction:

Then your magic variable name would be `${checklist-appsec-checklist}`. You can enter this anywhere in the report and it will replace it with the table as shown below:
